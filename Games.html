        <h3> Overwatch series </h3>
        <p> The original Overwatch game was released by Blizzard on May 24, 2016, for PC platforms, as well as eighth
            generation console platforms PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A version of the game developed by Iron Galaxy
            for the Nintendo Switch was later released on October 15, 2019. Blizzard shut down servers for the game
            on October 3, 2022.

            Blizzard released Overwatch 2 via early access on October 4, 2022. The game was made free-to-play on PC
            and for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X platforms, and employed full cross-platform play. </p>

        <h3> Heroes of the Storm crossover </h3>
        <p> Until the warm reception of Overwatch's beta, Blizzard was unsure of representing Overwatch characters in
            Heroes of the Storm, their crossover multiplayer battle online arena (MOBA) video game. Around a month
            prior to the release of Overwatch, Blizzard added Tracer to the MOBA; PC Gamer called Tracer's addition to
            the game "a marketing move [for Overwatch], for sure." Afterwards, other characters and map elements
            from Overwatch were incorporated into Heroes. By the time the game transitioned to a permanent maintenance
            mode in July 2022, a total of nine characters became playable in Heroes of the Storm, while
            battlegrounds based on the Overwatch maps Hanamura and Volskaya Industries were also included. A number of
            Overwatch-themed skins have been introduced for Heroes of the Storm's "Overwatch cosplay" event in May
            2021. </p>
