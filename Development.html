        <p> Prior to the original game's announcement, Blizzard had been interested in making a team-based multiplayer
            shooter for a while. Overwatch has its development origins rooted in Titan, a Blizzard project that was
            cancelled in 2013. Elements of Titan were reworked into Overwatch, which was announced at BlizzCon in
            November 2014. Overwatch became Blizzard's first new series since they launched Diablo in 1996, as
            well as their first attempt at making an FPS game. After the game's announcement, Polygon wrote that it
            "appears to feature Blizzard's signature chunky, slightly cartoonish style." A beta for the game was
            launched in 2015. </p>

        <p> Jeff Kaplan, Michael Chu, and Scott Mercer served as the game's lead director, lead writer, and principal
            game designer, respectively. Blizzard hired writer Alyssa Wong to Overwatch's writing team in
            2018. Kaplan departed from Blizzard in April 2021, after which Aaron Keller took over Kaplan's duties as
            lead director. </p>

        <p> After the release of Overwatch, Blizzard's developers continued to add to the game through free updates,
            introducing new characters, maps, game modes, and cosmetic items, often as part of seasonal events.
            The different gameplays of individual heroes were also tuned and patched in response to player feedback and
            statistics regarding the meta found within the game. As Kaplan followed a philosophy that emphasized
            players' perception of game balance, he affirmed that meta shifts to Overwatch were beholden to its players
            and not its developers; Heroes Never Die wrote on Kaplan's belief that if the community thought Overwatch's
            meta was broken, then it actually was and vice versa. </p>
