        <h2> E-Sports </h2>
        <p> While not originally developed with esport support in mind, Overwatch would see a considerable esport scene
            prop up around the franchise shortly after its first game's release. According to Kaplan, although Blizzard
            had success with committing to esports while developing Starcraft II, they found "it's dangerous to be
            overly committed to esport too early in the lifespan of the game. "To avoid sacrificing approachability
            as they did with Starcraft II, Blizzard opted to gauge how the Overwatch community would develop around
            esports over time as they did with Hearthstone. This included the introduction of the game's competitive
            mode some months after the game's launch after seeing how players took towards Overwatch; Blizzard saw the
            ladder-approach they used as a means for skilled players to reach high ranks as to be noticed by esport team
            organizers. ESPN and Gamasutra wrote that the game had a favorable foundation to succeed as an esports
            title, citing the game's sufficient difference from established esports games, its variety in maps and
            characters, and strong support from its developer, as well as its speed and short match times. </p>

        <p> The first organized, prize-winning competitions for Overwatch started in mid-2016, a few months after
            launch. The esports organizer ESL held the first international Overwatch competition in August 2016, dubbed
            the Overwatch Atlantic Showdown. The competition used four open qualifiers beginning in June, followed
            by regional qualifiers and then a final online qualifier. Eight teams then competed for a six-figure prize
            in the finals to be held at Gamescom 2016 from August 20 to 21. Turner Broadcasting's ELeague announced
            the first Overwatch Open tournament, starting in July 2016, with a total prize pool of $300,000, with plans
            to broadcast the finals on Turner's cable channel TBS in September 2016. </p>

        <p> Blizzard announced its own official Overwatch World Cup (OWWC) tournament in August 2016. The first
            annual OWWC would be played later that November at BlizzCon 2016, where Blizzard also announced the
            formation of their Overwatch League (OWL). </p>

        <p> The OWL borrowed various elements from traditional sports leagues like the National Football League
            (NFL), including a developmental league called Overwatch Contenders (OWC). The OWL also
            implemented permanent teams organized in league placements rather than the use of promotion and
            relegation. The OWL secured billionaire sports team owners to become OWL team owners and established
            12 franchises around the world by September 2017, with plans to expand further in later seasons.
            Contracted players on these franchises are guaranteed a minimum salary, benefits, and revenue sharing.
            Preseason games for the inaugural OWL season took place in December 2017. The first OWL regular season
            game was played between the Los Angeles Valiant and San Francisco Shock to a sold out crowd at Blizzard
            Arena in January 2018. To support viewership of its professional competitions, Blizzard released a
            companion Overwatch application in November 2018, which allowed viewers to watch matches through a spectator
            mode.</p>

        <p> Overwatch achieved a high level of popularity as an esport in South Korea, with the first game surpassing
            League of Legends and topping gaming cafés in the country in terms of player count. The game also
            influenced the creation of an esports tournament in the region, under the brand name "APEX", which operated
            until January 2018. </p>
