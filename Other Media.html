        <h2> Other media </h2>
        <p> Overwatch was developed to lack a traditional story or campaign mode and instead Blizzard conveyed narrative
            elements through a transmedia storytelling method. While voice lines and map elements in Overwatch
            reveal some of its universe's lore, the bulk of the story surrounding its characters is told through
            animated short films and literary media. Character biographies and fake news reports containing
            story pieces have also been published on Blizzard's website. Chu remarked that Blizzard's method of
            storytelling with Overwatch demonstrated a "gameplay first" philosophy. </p>

        <h3> Animations </h3>

            <figcaption> Overwatch characters as they appear in the Zero Hour cinematic trailer (2019) </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> As part of the original game's announcement, Blizzard released an animated "cinematic trailer" for Overwatch
            on November 7, 2014. They would repeat this to announce Overwatch 2, releasing the Zero Hour
            cinematic trailer in 2019. </p>

        <p> Blizzard also released animated short films to help flesh out "the real meat" of Overwatch's lore. These
            shorts employed 3D computer-generated animation, and received praise from video game journalists, with
            some likening their quality to those of works from Disney and Pixar.[note 5] that Recall, the first of these
            shorts, was released on March 21, 2016. It was centered around Reaper's attack on Winston at Gibraltar
            and Winston's following recall of former Overwatch agents. Blizzard released nine more shorts through
            2018; Reunion was the last of these shorts until The Wastelander was released in 2022. </p>

        <p> Aside from short films, Blizzard also released "origin story" videos for Soldier: 76 and each character
            added to Overwatch's playable roster post-launch. An origin story for King's Row Uprising, a tie-in for an
            in-game event was also released. These origin story videos are designed to provide players with the
            background of new characters. Origin stories are animated in the style of motion comics and are shorter
            than Blizzard's 3D-animated short films. </p>

        <h3> Comics </h3>

            <img src="/assets/img/960x0.jpg" alt="Tracer - London Calling">
        </figure>
        <p> From 2016 to 2018, Blizzard published Overwatch, a 16-issue comic series, beginning with "Trainhopper".
            Some issues, such as "Uprising", served as tie-ins to in-game events. Motion comic versions of the
            series were also released, produced by Madefire Studios. These motion comics included sound effects
            and official music featured in-game. Originally a digital comic series, Blizzard partnered with Dark
            Horse Comics to publish a hardcover anthology in 2017, which collected the series' 12 issues released to
            that point. An expanded edition of the anthology was released in December 2021. </p>

        <p> From 2020 to 2021, Blizzard and Dark Horse published Tracer - London Calling a five-issue limited
            series. Written by Mariko Tamaki and illustrated by Babs Tarr, print versions of each issue were also
            released. Rachael Cohen and Deron Bennett served as the series' colorist and letterer, respectively.
            A graphic novel collecting the five issues and featuring cover art by artist Bengal was physically released
            on September 28, 2021. </p>

        <p> Another five-issue limited series, New Blood was released from November 2021 to March 2022. Similar
            in style to London Calling, the series followed Cassidy post-Zero Hour on his journey to recruit members to
            the newly revived Overwatch. Both London Calling and New Blood also served as tie-ins for in-game
            seasonal events. </p>

        <h3> Merchandising </h3>
        <p> The popularity of Overwatch led various companies to launch merchandise lines featuring its characters.
            Funko produced several figurines as part of their "Pop!" line. Tracer is featured prominently in Good
            Smile Company's merchandise, with the company distributing both Nendoroid and Figma figurines of the
            character. Good Smile has also featured other Overwatch characters in their lines. LEGO has also
            produced an Overwatch set of figurines. As part of their Rivals line, Nerf has designed
            Overwatch-stylized toy guns. Nerf's parent company, Hasbro, later launched a set of action figures
            featuring Overwatch characters. </p>
