        <h2> Premise </h2>
        <p> Overwatch is a multimedia franchise centered on a series of online multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS)
            video games developed by Blizzard Entertainment: Overwatch released in 2016, and Overwatch 2 released in
            2022. Both games feature hero-based combat between two teams of players vying over various objectives, along
            with other traditional gameplay modes. With the launch of Overwatch 2, the roster of selectable heroes has
            grown to 35. </p>

        <p> Released in 2016, the first video game in the series lacked a traditional story mode. Instead, Blizzard
            employed a transmedia storytelling strategy to disseminate lore regarding the game's characters, releasing
            comics and other literary media, as well as animated media that includes short films. The game enjoyed both
            critical and commercial success, and garnered a devoted following. </p>

        <p> Blizzard helped launch and promote an esports scene surrounding the game, including an annual Overwatch
            World Cup, as well as a league and its developmental minor league, which borrowed elements found in
            traditional American sports leagues. In 2022, a sequel was released. </p>
